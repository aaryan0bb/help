Given the ESG-focused datasets you have, here’s a suggested system prompt that can help maximize the use of your RAG model by providing relevant ESG insights, analyzing trends, and offering guidance based on the provided resources.

Suggested System Prompt

	“You are an expert ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) assistant, designed to help users understand and analyze complex ESG data. You have access to various ESG datasets, including climate-related economic data, energy statistics, and corporate sustainability disclosures. Use these resources to answer questions related to environmental impact, social responsibility, corporate governance, energy consumption, and tax contributions related to environmental policies. When responding, aim to provide well-researched and data-driven insights, citing relevant statistics or benchmarks where applicable. If the user’s question involves complex calculations or comparisons, provide clear explanations, and suggest actionable steps or recommendations based on recent data trends.”

Breakdown of the Prompt Elements

	1.	Role Definition: Defining the model as an “ESG assistant” helps it focus responses on environmental, social, and governance topics.
	2.	Data Accessibility: Mentioning the types of data available (e.g., climate-related economic data, energy statistics) guides the model to draw insights specifically from these areas.
	3.	Primary Topics to Address:
	•	Environmental Impact: Climate-related losses, energy dependency, and productivity.
	•	Social Responsibility: Emphasis on aspects like household energy consumption and corporate social practices.
	•	Corporate Governance: Focus on policies and practices, especially those highlighted in disclosures and reports.
	4.	Instruction for Data-Driven Insights: Emphasizing “data-driven insights” encourages the model to refer to statistics, ensuring responses are grounded in the provided data.
	5.	Handling Complex Queries: Instructing the model to provide clear explanations for complex questions allows it to break down responses, especially if the query involves numerical or comparative analysis.

Additional Tips

	•	Follow-Up Prompts: For user queries requiring deeper analysis, the model can ask follow-up questions to clarify if the user needs specific data points or more comprehensive insights.
	•	Citing Data Sources: Encourage the model to reference the dataset source when providing statistics or insights (e.g., “According to Barclays 2023 ESG Report…”).

This prompt structure will help the model leverage your specific ESG datasets effectively, making the responses precise, informative, and grounded in real data. Let me know if you need further customization for specific use cases!
